# About thePlanet adventure game engine

I have always wanted to create a point and click adventure game ever since the days when I was a teenager and played Monkey Island. ThePlanet is my attempt at creating an adventure game engine in C++ and SDL2. This is a work in progress project with many areas for improvement and enhancement. This has been a learning journey for myself in creating games in C++ and has been a very tough learning experience but very rewarding at the same time. I do hope that this code will help others like me who have always dreamed about creating a point and click adventure game but just don't know where to start. Starting out programming in C++ is a daunting task for any beginner and it seems like a mountain to climb. I hope this might help others get started and create their own "Better" versions of this engine. I am looking forward to people contributing improvements!

The most challenging part of programming in C++ and SDL2 is from my point of view (Memory management). Many hours I have spent trying to figure out why my RAM suddenly shoots up and how to effectively deal with textures properly to prevent memory leaks. In its current form I think that it is fairly stable and I have managed to overcome the memory leaks to the best of my knowledge.

This project was created in Visual Studio 2019.

Images used in making the scenes were to the best of my knowledge all from google images free to use searches.
